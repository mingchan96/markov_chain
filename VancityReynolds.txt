@gordsteinke thank you, gord! i only have a couple photos of my grandfather. and none when he was a young man. this means a lot to me... sometimes twitter isn’t a giant swimming pool filled with digital rabies. 🙌

@epicvoiceguy @aviationgin @freeguymovie i’m nothing, if not a fan of helvetica.
@cierra_montoya cierra, i don’t pretend to know your situation. but when i was starting out, the greatest lesson i learned was to embrace anxiety. even (gulp) love it. once i stopped hiding it and hating myself for it, everything got better. i got better.
@sportsnet @nhl ...so you’re saying there’s a chance.
@ryansbergara @shanemadej you guys look so real in this photo!
@abukole @vincenzolandino @aviationgin yes! take the wheel.

@robgronkowski true story... during deadpool 1, we used your face to model the character of colossus after. for whatever reason, we couldn’t get clearance. you’d have made a lovely colossus. the point is, i won’t be at gronk beach.
