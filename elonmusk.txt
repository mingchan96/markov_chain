@Universe_SkyArt @TwitterSupport I just sent a note to Twitter to clarify that posting SpaceX videos is fine by us and we paid for rights to Bowie song for the Falcon Heavy launch#
@LeeHudson_ @LockheedMartin The competitor should be a drone fighter plane that‚Äôs remote controlled by a human, but with its maneuvers augmented by autonomy. The F-35 would have no chance against it.#
@Teslarati It‚Äôs not that big really#
@SpaceX Testing Raptor in vertical configuration (on the giant tripod) should allow us to simplify some aspects of the engine design#
@newscientist It‚Äôs not mine#
@Foxfire40900590 Definitely! What‚Äôs in that sky city thing!?  Needs a prequel even more than a sequel.#
@Erdayastronaut @JaneidyEve @JakeTheHuman28 @tesla_truth @Twitter Sure#
@JaneidyEve @JakeTheHuman28 @tesla_truth @Twitter Posting SpaceX videos is definitely not copyright infringement!#
@j_brorsson @Teslarati Hopefully, in March. Checking ‚Ä¶#
@Teslarati I had no idea this existed. Sounds awesome though!#
@RationalEtienne @Bryr32 Full disclosure, I‚Äôm actually a 3000 year old vampire. It‚Äôs such a trial assuming all these false identities over the centuries!#
@Bryr32 We had the wrong settings! To make the welds super flat &amp; strong, we‚Äôre building a heavy duty, custom planisher, but just having the right settings is a major improvement.#

@PPathole @Erdayastronaut @Teslarati Yes, will also show real-time changes to max acceleration, braking, cornering, speed on gradient &amp; range, latter factoring in route elevation changes &amp; cargo or tow mass &amp; drag impact#
@Erdayastronaut @Teslarati It‚Äôs slightly better#
@nichegamer Definitely worth trying imo#
@Teslarati Btw, in some prior tweets I‚Äôd said production Cybertruck would be ~80‚Äù wide (vs ~84‚Äù body width at unveil). This is slightly too small. Will be closer to 82‚Äù, but come standard with upper laser blade lights.#

@flcnhvy @SciGuySpace F9 iteration slowed down as payloads became too important to risk. Little change is expected going forward with F9/FH or Dragon. Starship production &amp; thus iterative improvement will be much faster than Falcon. Driving hard for fully reusable orbital flight this year!#
@PPathole @JohnHanzl It‚Äôs mostly to balance the ship during entry. After delivering satellites, the front is light &amp; back is heavy due to engines &amp; landing legs.#
@JohnHanzl Sorry, meant to say LOX header tank in tip of nose. CH4 main tank is above LOX main.#
@JohnHanzl LOX#
@SciGuySpace These problems are fundamentally intertwined. Building many rockets allows for successive approximation. Progress in any given technology is simply # of iterations * progress between iterations.#
@SciGuySpace Hardest problem by far is building the production system of something this big. 2nd hardest is achieving full &amp; rapid reuse with payload to orbit of ~2%.#
@flcnhvy @sydney_ev Probably#
@sydney_ev Attach wheels to the landing legs &amp; tow Starship to the launch pad#
@RationalEtienne I rate it two Bugblatter Beasts of Traal up!#
High bay for stacking Starship engine bay, propellant tanks &amp; fairing (fka nosecone) sections is almost done! https://t.co/G9h0430ns2#
@pentaquarky @Erdayastronaut The whole nose tip has to have heat shielding for atmospheric entry at Mach 25+ anyway, so is effectively already insulated well in orbit#
@tobyliiiiiiiiii @Erdayastronaut There will be a common area in the forward section with a big window like this. It will be a lot heavier than steel, but not dangerous. Consider astronauts on the moon with a very thin windowed helmet. They were fine.#
@PPathole @Erdayastronaut Header tanks are only ~2% of main tank volume, so not a big deal. Pressurized volume is still ~1000 cubic meters.#

@BLKMDL3 @jgrano305 @DMC_Ryan @Jason X will also improve by a similar amount#
@jgrano305 @BLKMDL3 @DMC_Ryan @Jason Depends on when car was built, as there are many small hardware improvements, so most will be somewhere in between 373 &amp; 390#
@jgrano305 @DMC_Ryan @Jason Regulations require calling it something else, so we added +#
@DMC_Ryan @Jason There‚Äôs a tough performance vs range tradeoff. Plaid has absurd performance, while holding range roughly constant.#
@PPathole Software just thinks the car is less efficient than it actually is#
@PPathole Many small hardware improvements throughout the car that have been introduced gradually over past several months#
@teslaownersSV Maybe possible with improved wheels/tires (which would be available to all previously made cars)#
All S/X cars made in recent months have actually been above stated EPA range. Will be unlocked soon for free via software update.#
Tesla Model S estimated EPA range is now above 390 miles or ~630 km https://t.co/sNFzIkuJpC#

@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @robert_zubrin The joints will have shielding, but it‚Äôs hard to ensure a good seal. Transpiration cooling (or simply higher pressure cold gas flow) would purge the area behind the hot gas seal.#
@Erdayastronaut @robert_zubrin Might be used around flap joints#
@teslaownersSV @Tesla Will take action#
Only the heart senses beauty#
@Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @robert_zubrin Shielding is only needed for orbital speeds#

@Erdayastronaut @robert_zubrin Unfortunately, Starship unlikely to survive LEO entry intact without shielding on windward side, but none required on leeward. Even windward shielding is very light.#

The degree to which SolarGlass will positively effect the esthetics &amp; energy sustainability of neighborhoods throughout the world is not yet well appreciated. This is a very important product.#
Tesla April company talk will be from our Giga New York factory, where we make SolarGlass &amp; several other products. Will also offer customer &amp; media tours.#
Should preface this saying that feedback from early Tesla Solar roof owners has been v positive. It‚Äôs stunning vs a regular roof in person imo. Photos don‚Äôt do it justice.#
@brittanygayle98 Its integrated roof &amp; solar, so should be light enough for almost any home#
@dafuq_mac Coming hopefully later this year#
@TarunBhatt161 I think will still be better than a normal roof, but adding a heating grid to automatically remove ice &amp; snow sounds like a good option. We have that already on car windows!#
@Emmonstein No problem. Snow and ice tend to slide off the Tesla SolarGlass due to lower surface roughness, so accumulates less than a normal roof. Even so, it‚Äôs very strong and can be walked on without breaking the glass tiles.#
@_mantis_ Sounds should note that it gets less shiny automatically due to dust &amp; weathering. This pic is brand new.#
@_mantis_ Ok#
@G_d_Photographr Sounds like we should open a Tesla Center there!#
Please let us know what improvements we can make to any aspect of Tesla SolarGlass roof! Critical feedback is much appreciated.#

@JaneidyEve You‚Äôre welcome! Was a fun recruiting event. Great to see all the excitement about helping build Starships.#
@Teslarati @13ericralph31 Unmodified water tower machines do not work well for orbital rockets, as mass efficiency is critical for the latter, but not the former. Hopper, for example, was made of 12.5mm steel vs 4mm for SN1 orbital design. Optimized skins will be &lt;2mm in places across a 9000mm diameter.#
@nextspaceflight @chraveesh @Teslarati No, they‚Äôre SN1. SN2 to follow shortly. Aiming to be a little better each time.#
@chraveesh @Teslarati Yes, we‚Äôre tuning weld parameters to reduce puckering &amp; building a heavy duty planisher to flatten &amp; cold work the weld area#
@Teslarati That said, although substantial capital &amp; engineering is required to achieve extreme precision, marginal production cost of the primary structure should actually be *less* than a water tower, because it‚Äôs built inside a factory in volume.#
@Teslarati This isn‚Äôt quite correct. An orbital rocket needs precision that‚Äôs 3X to 4X better than a water tower, so super precise parts, fixtures &amp; welding are needed. Suborbital is much more forgiving.#

@CathieDWood @sbarnettARK @jwangARK @ARKInvest First, we need to make it super safe &amp; easy to use, then determine greatest utility vs risk. From initially working to volume production &amp; implantation is a long road. As with vehicle safety, it will be much harder to pass our internal standards than minimum regulatory standards.#
@flcnhvy @Tesla @thirdrowtesla Ok sure üòÄ Btw, we recruit great engineers from almost anywhere in the world, so this shouldn‚Äôt be thought of as USA only. Also, work location can be Bay Area (preferred), but Austin (many of our chip designers are there) or potentially any Tesla Gigafactory.#
