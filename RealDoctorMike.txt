@phillyd i gotchu 😉 https://t.co/7mnb0rjcfr
@phillyd broooo 😂
the media has disappointed me lately with their coverage of #covid19 🦠 here is my fact-check on some of their top stories ⛑👉🏼 https://t.co/qeodqzcolf https://t.co/vvug9oumhb
@screenchart yay!
@bennettrun my man coach bennett knows what’s up! ⛑
sad to see that my #covid19 videos with milllions of views almost never come up on the top search results despite 100% facts from @cdc and @who https://t.co/apnseehjmt
definitely hurts the bottom line, but again overall a positive impact. similar to staying home when sick. not easy to do in competitive times &amp; when $ is hard to come by, but worth it to protect those who cannot protect themselves (elderly &amp; immunocompromised) #alertnotanxious https://t.co/npmtnzuebk
i personally love that. i have those same links in the descriptions of all my #coronavirus videos but to have them front and center like that is even better! great job @youtube @ytcreators 👍🏼⛑🦠 https://t.co/d8dysjwn4c
medical school never prepared me for this! a great @reddit thread on how doctors often times have to learn on the job. ⛑🎥👉🏼 https://t.co/8j3pgcland https://t.co/3daptpewld
@mamadoctorjones ahhh this is exactly what we’ve been missing in our coverage!! 👍🏼👍🏼🔥
@syarbel i don’t think that’s appropriate at this time.

not as ideal as proper hand washing but most definitely better than not! make sure to use a sanitizer that’s at least 60% alcohol and wait for it to evaporate before thinking you’re cleansed. https://t.co/6cxslffah1
update: i purchased subtitles for this video in 5 languages. will be live by eod.
@beckymccaleb @aafp @chubbyemu @cdcgov @who @aoafordos if you give it a couple min to update i think it’ll catch up. also, someone is slacking in watching the full videos 😜
@chubbyemu thank you sir. we must all band together in the fight against the mis-infodemic 💪🏼

when being a doctor/media person catches up to you 😂 doctors’s makeup palette?!? @jamescharles @shanedawson @jeffreestar https://t.co/rvvjyehdf2
@jamescharles sounds like you need a better doctor 🙇🏻
@stefheartsyou i saw that, but most experts agree that asymptomatic spread is possible (unknown timeline) but it will likely not be a main driver of disease.
supporting @pcfnews at the annual @nyfw blue jacket show! thanks to @johnvarvatos for the stylish look 🔥 https://t.co/g0iz4zsuil

@sarah_mojarad when filming my first intro video,
my videographer doubted i was a real doctor because of how poorly i spoke on camera.
sometimes in life there will be those who cross you. just remember the best thing you can do is learn &amp; move on.
just filmed an update to the #coronavirus situation. will be live wednesday 5pm est!
@medcrisis that one is solid. you may have missed my *high five moment with @mollybofficial 😂😂

@chantellx0 @heygurlhey89 @nicolconcilio that is a title to redirect resources and hold countries accountable. it is not an excuse to panic.
@gaijin5 sorry, trying to get the message out there! #misinformation
@jeannkhoo all of my videos are subtitled professionally in english &amp; spanish!
@claraquiambao of course, thanks for your rt!
this is trash. he thinks it’s cute (satire) but actually it’s horrible misinformation that i equate to yelling “fire” in a crowded movie theatre. #coronaravirus https://t.co/ot8eu9xa3g
@allergykidsdoc thanks so much for this and your expertise on our collab! #comingsoon
