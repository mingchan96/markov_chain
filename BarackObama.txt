after a lifetime of reaching for the stars, today, katherine johnson landed among them. she spent decades as a hidden figure, breaking barriers behind the scenes. but by the end of her life, she had become a hero to millions—including michelle and me. https://t.co/isg29nwbib
happy birthday to one of my heroes — someone who believed our right to vote was more important than his own life. thanks for making good trouble for 80 years, @repjohnlewis. https://t.co/lqmuvmpblp

here are a couple of articles that are worth reading — from housing to health, these stories use data to explore challenges we face and demonstrate how policy solutions along with civic engagement can make a real difference in people’s lives.
https://t.co/g6eiuwumqv
eleven years ago today, near the bottom of the worst recession in generations, i signed the recovery act, paving the way for more than a decade of economic growth and the longest streak of job creation in american history. https://t.co/bmdxrxuauf
happy valentine’s day to my forever dance partner, @michelleobama. https://t.co/lhvtguwehr
what a great example of citizenship, what each of us can do to make a difference for all of us: https://t.co/yxsvonuuvl
even if the methods are new, sowing the seeds of doubt, division, and discord to turn americans against each other is an old trick. the antidote is citizenship: to get engaged, organized, mobilized, and to vote - on every level, in every election. https://t.co/yovaczytrw
thirty years on, i remember the hope we all felt watching mandela’s release from prison. the gift of a new way of seeing. the chance to participate in the work of building a better world. the ultimate example of perseverance and faith for each new generation to follow.
congrats to julia and steven, the filmmakers behind american factory, for telling such a complex, moving story about the very human consequences of wrenching economic change. glad to see two talented and downright good people take home the oscar for higher ground’s first release. https://t.co/w4az68iwoy
sixty years ago today, the greensboro four stood up to injustice by sitting down at a lunch counter. our journey is full of such stories; of acts of patriotic protest that challenge this country we love to live up to our highest ideals, however long it takes. #blackhistorymonth
kobe was a legend on the court and just getting started in what would have been just as meaningful a second act. to lose gianna is even more heartbreaking to us as parents. michelle and i send love and prayers to vanessa and the entire bryant family on an unthinkable day.
every so often, i re-read dr. king’s letter from a birmingham jail. while some of the injustices may have changed, his poetic brilliance, moral clarity, and tests of conscience still reverberate today. take a moment to reflect on his righteous call: https://t.co/obdqfqdwa6
in every scene, you are my star, @michelleobama! happy birthday, baby! https://t.co/hgmbhhasbj
glad to see american factory’s oscar nod for best documentary. it’s the kind of story we don’t see often enough and it’s exactly what michelle and i hope to achieve with higher ground. congrats to the incredible filmmakers and entire team!
our fellow americans in puerto rico can use our support after this week’s earthquakes. they’ve shown their enduring spirit over the past couple years, and it’s up to us to pull together for one another once again. i hope you’ll support their recovery: https://t.co/ryhsb8uvxk
here’s the thing: even with problems of this magnitude, each of us can still find a way to make change. that’s why i’m proud of young people like alice mahar, a environmental activist in melbourne. read about her and find ways you can help, too: https://t.co/qahfibgw6b
the catastrophic fires in australia are the latest example of the very real and very urgent consequences of climate change. it’s on us to stay focused and protect the one planet we’ve got for the next generation: https://t.co/dqytaupexf
with david stern’s passing, i’m reflecting on everything he did to take the nba global, creating entire new generations of fans pretending to be like mike or any of their favorite players on driveways and playgrounds around the world. https://t.co/8qmcazx2fs
here’s to a happy, healthy, and hopeful 2020. happy new year, everybody!
from hip-hop to country to the boss, here are my songs of the year. if you’re looking for something to keep you company on a long drive or help you turn up a workout, i hope there’s a track or two in here that does the trick. https://t.co/mq2vssydwt
if there’s one thing i love about @repjohnlewis, it’s his incomparable will to fight. i know he’s got a lot more of that left in him. praying for you, my friend.
next up are my favorite movies and tv shows of 2019. of course, there’s also american factory, a film from our own production company, higher ground, that was recently shortlisted for an oscar. here’s the full list: https://t.co/pecgwotcxm
as we wind down 2019, i wanted to share with you my annual list of favorites that made the last year a little brighter. we’ll start with books today — movies and music coming soon. i hope you enjoy these as much as i did. https://t.co/l5qtgkapok

it was remarkable to be back in the asia-pacific region with my sister this week, joined by hundreds of talented and optimistic @obamafoundation leaders. they’re making their mark on this region—and the whole world—and that's good for all of us. https://t.co/lsbwozclif
my sister maya and i are about to take the stage at @obamafoundation leaders: asia-pacific. we'll be talking about how growing up in this region made us who we are—and the opportunity today's young people have to shape the future. i hope you'll tune in at https://t.co/robfherms1

in vietnam i had the chance to sit down with some of our @obamafoundation leaders and alumni from across the asia pacific. from combating climate change in vietnam to evaluating social impact in indonesia, they're doing extraordinary work and expanding their impact together. https://t.co/3h2bivzt2d
because of paul volcker, our financial system is stronger and safer for the american people. i’ll remember paul for his consummate wisdom, untethered honesty, and a level of dignity that matched his towering stature. i’m proud to have called him not just an adviser, but a friend. https://t.co/m3zfr6q0uf
today, we give thanks for our blessings, give back to those around us, and enjoy some time — and turkey, and maybe a little football — with the ones we love. from the obama family to yours, happy thanksgiving. https://t.co/gezsgansge
before arguing with friends or family around the thanksgiving table, take a look at the science behind arguing better. and it'll never hurt to try this: "listen to people, get them to think about their own experience, and highlight your common humanity." https://t.co/azc9kpqoqx
politicians shouldn’t be picking their voters. voters should be picking their representatives. but unless we act, the status quo will remain in states all across the country. let's make sure maps are drawn fairly when redistricting happens again in 2021: https://t.co/pi2gd2b4bv
take a look at this piece to understand the very real consequences of gerrymandering. in asheville, nc, we see what happens when district lines are drawn for maximum partisan advantage: it mean citizens’ voices are diminished. it means more polarization. https://t.co/clbqlpftsu
young leaders like these are powering the promise of the asia pacific region. michelle and i couldn’t be more impressed by their initiative. can’t wait to join them in malaysia next month. https://t.co/jrure7d6uv
proud to see oluwaseun @ayodejiosowobi in this list. she’s an @obamafoundation leader who’s organizing young people in nigeria to help end sexual violence, and her work embodies what our foundation is all about: passing the baton to the next generation. https://t.co/jskunrtaod
stories like this are a reminder of our duty, as a country and as americans, to support every veteran—not only in words, but in deed. to every veteran out there, thank you. we’re forever in your debt.
this veterans day, here’s a moving portrait of the extraordinary resilience of my friend cory remsburg, an army ranger i’ve come to know over the years. it’s an honest tribute to all those wounded warriors and their families who give so much to our country https://t.co/rbamnk0zvb
no one says it better than @michelleobama — the obama presidential center coming to the south side isn't for us, it's for the community and the next generation of leaders. https://t.co/ahhenvaisn
proud of all the americans who showed up to vote yesterday, electing a set of hopeful, forward-thinking leaders primed to protect medicaid, draw fair voting maps, and reduce gun violence. a great night for our country—one that’ll leave a lasting legacy.
proud to endorse an outstanding group of virginia democrats in tuesday’s election—candidates who’ll not only advance the causes of equality, justice, and decency, but help ensure that the next decade of voting maps are drawn fairly. that’s good policy—and good for our politics. https://t.co/iljmkbq7gm
today’s the first day of open enrollment on https://t.co/ob1ynoesod, and high-quality coverage might be more affordable than you think. nearly 9 in 10 https://t.co/ob1ynoesod customers qualify for financial help—so if you or someone you know needs insurance, #getcovered today.
congrats to the world champion @nationals and their fans! a great group that always showed up when it counted and was never afraid to show a little joy: dancing in the dugout, laughing, believing, and always sticking together. a true team with a spirit that’d do us all well.
glad to be back in chicago for the @obamafoundation summit. it’s where i first learned to organize—and where i met @michelleobama. we all have places that define us, and at the summit, we’ll be exploring the meaning behind them—tune in tomorrow at https://t.co/swmrhub5y4. https://t.co/oymfsdzvnm
.@samanthajpower is a pulitzer winner, an incredible writer, and a great friend. her memoir, the education of an idealist, grapples with the balance between idealism, pragmatism, advocacy, and governance. it's a must-read for anyone who cares about our role in a changing world.
michelle and i are heartbroken over the passing of our friend, elijah cummings. may his example inspire more americans to pick up the baton and carry it forward in a manner worthy of his service. https://t.co/lm2res3pnv
i was proud to work with justin trudeau as president. he's a hard-working, effective leader who takes on big issues like climate change. the world needs his progressive leadership now, and i hope our neighbors to the north support him for another term.
in december, michelle and i will head to malaysia for the first @obamafoundation leaders: asia-pacific gathering. the region plays an important role in my own story, and today, it’s home to a generation of rising leaders ready to create a better world. we can’t wait to join them. https://t.co/ldfdwxmi8j
yesterday, marathoner eliud kipchoge became the first ever to break two hours. today in chicago, brigid kosgei set a new women’s world record. staggering achievements on their own, they’re also remarkable examples of humanity’s ability to endure—and keep raising the bar.
congrats to the @washmystics on a gutsy, first-ever championship! a great team performance when it counted. if folks aren’t careful, this title thing might become a habit in dc.
here’s an interesting read—a reminder that behind every opinion lies a human being with real experiences and a story to tell. sometimes we’ll agree and sometimes we won’t, but if we want our democracy work, listening to each other isn’t optional. https://t.co/8d4fpuprlu
as president, i leaned on @ambassadorrice’s experience, expertise, and willingness to tell me what i needed to hear. in her memoir, tough love, you’ll see why. it’s a tribute to american leadership—and a unifying call for us to do our part to protect it. i hope you’ll read it. https://t.co/7iuwt76xuw
like the beatles said: it’s getting better all the time. thanks, babe, for 27 amazing years! https://t.co/mimrqiyn1r
on national voter registration day, it’s up to us as citizens to make sure everyone we know can make their voices heard at the ballot box. check and update your registration at https://t.co/nkxrgngbzx — and tell your friends, too.
one challenge will define the future for today’s young generation more dramatically than any other: climate change. the millions of young people worldwide who’ve organized and joined today’s #climatestrike demand action to protect our planet, and they deserve it.
just 16, @gretathunberg is already one of our planet’s greatest advocates. recognizing that her generation will bear the brunt of climate change, she’s unafraid to push for real action. she embodies our vision at the @obamafoundation: a future shaped by young leaders like her. https://t.co/vgcpaadp3c
that’s what americans do when others are in need – we help. we give. we inspire. want to make a difference? there are a number of ways you can help right here: https://t.co/cnrcafnik2

bahamian families and communities face a long recovery from hurricane dorian. and americans are reaching out to help. brittany garvin is helping people reunite and evacuate. https://t.co/k5hxu68rph
as we remember those we lost on 9/11, we also remember the spirit of unity and togetherness that defined the weeks and months after. on this day of service, i’m reflecting on all those still working to embrace that spirit, today and every day. https://t.co/y8x9pvcwdl
marca had a remarkable way of bringing out the best within us. for me, she was a trusted voice and a persistent, buoyant spirit—an example that progress can be slow, but it’s always possible. we’ll miss her, but we’re far better off because of her fight. https://t.co/gvkqventis
yesterday’s ruling is a big win for north carolina—and for all of us. voters should choose their representatives, not the other way around. this win is proof that change is always within our reach, on gerrymandering, voting rights, and much more. https://t.co/svlkm1jait

a good story gives you the chance to better understand someone else’s life. it can help you find common ground. and it’s why michelle and i were drawn to higher ground’s first film, american factory. take a look at our conversation with the directors, and check it out on netflix. https://t.co/kzkyfqjrfv
toni morrison was a national treasure, as good a storyteller, as captivating, in person as she was on the page. her writing was a beautiful, meaningful challenge to our conscience and our moral imagination. what a gift to breathe the same air as her, if only for a while. https://t.co/jg7jgu4p9t

recent court decisions make it clear that the change we need to restore our democracy has to come from the ground up. @allontheline’s work to ensure an accurate census count and achieve fair maps in 2021 has never been more important. join us today: https://t.co/d9zwitunoa https://t.co/mebwkcduip

here are a couple of articles backed by new research that are worth taking a look at: a new study on the medicaid expansion my administration fought for under the affordable care act—and how these policy decisions affect lives in real terms: https://t.co/lj4g7lgfnq
in america, we don’t fear the future, we embrace it. 50 years ago, that spirit took us to the moon. today, it’s embodied by people like tiffany davis. she’s a young rocket scientist who is helping us explore the next frontier, wherever that might take us. https://t.co/a573n8hqtg
#mandeladay reminds us that when things feel dark, confusing, or impossible—take a look back at his writings. there, we see how a belief in the dignity of every person can be made real, an unwavering hope to steel us along our own long walks toward something better. https://t.co/fkgrvrihhc

outside the oval office, i kept a painting of a small crowd huddled around a pocketwatch, waiting for the moment the emancipation proclamation took effect. on juneteenth, we celebrate the anniversary of that news - freedom - reaching slaves in texas. and something more: https://t.co/ksklhbfnc3
this is worth a read: a thought-provoking reminder that education reform isn’t a cure-all. as a supporter of education reform, i agree that fixing educational inequality requires doing more to address the broader, systemic sources of economic inequality. https://t.co/96b7fkbm4u

and in the u.s., 13-year old @alexandriav2005 of new york, 13-year old @havenruthie of denver, and 16-year old @israhirsi of minneapolis are some of the young people leading the fight at home. i hope more of us will follow their example. https://t.co/qe08cghbei
i met 23-year-old @luisamneubauer in berlin earlier this month. luisa, the organizer behind the student movement in germany, says, “it’s our future and we’re not going to stop fighting for it.” https://t.co/hs03pcwyaq
they're people like 16-year-old @gretathunberg, whose protests at swedish parliament sparked a movement. inspired by greta's action, fridays for future brought together more than a million strikers on every continent last month to demand action on climate. https://t.co/un7nbhef8i

the floods in the midwest and in southern africa are heartbreaking. suffering and loss on two sides of the world calls for solidarity and strength from all of us. ask what you can do to help our fellow americans and families in need. here are some ideas: https://t.co/jwjlkabqab
in 2011, i visited the tiny town of moneygall and got to walk around in the house where my great-great-great grandfather falmouth kearney lived his early life. i'll always be grateful for the warmth and generosity of the irish people. happy st. patrick's day! -barack o’bama https://t.co/abdtarfbr5
michelle and i send our condolences to the people of new zealand. we grieve with you and the muslim community. all of us must stand against hatred in all its forms.
.@michelleobama and i are rooting hard for team usa as the special olympics world games get underway this week. our special olympians are terrific examples of america’s heart and drive.
what a great moment. happy 110th, virginia. https://t.co/funzv3rrv4
michelle and i send our deepest sympathies to all who knew the victims of today’s plane crash in ethiopia.
the crew dragon’s been on quite a ride since i last saw it—congrats to @nasa and @spacex on a successful return! we invested in the @commercial_crew program to strengthen the u.s. space program for the long haul, and it’s great to see that happening. https://t.co/dsu5mzcacz
preethi, alice, and sefora are just three of many @obamafoundation leaders who remind us what international women’s day is all about: imagining a world free of artificial ceilings for the next generation—and doing the hard work to get us there.
and @seforakodjo is helping the next generation of women leaders in africa rise up. her organization is training and mentoring young women across the continent to adopt a new model of leadership, one that puts gender equality at the heart of economic development. https://t.co/crb4ekcrvv
.@barbealice is helping refugees resettle into welcoming communities in france, offering them job training and language immersion, as well as a place to stay. more importantly, she’s fighting a narrative that suggests our differences are more important than our shared humanity. https://t.co/jniikiazao
.@preethiherman is helping women unleash their power to change their societies. as head of the https://t.co/3rwhe5razz foundation, she’s leading an initiative that combines online tools with in-person organizing, giving women a voice in her native india—and beyond. https://t.co/tkuakvl5y1
on international women’s day, i’m reflecting on the future we all want for our daughters: one where they can live out their aspirations without limits. and i’m celebrating some of the women who are building that future for all of us today.
it’s up to all of us as citizens to make sure that the rules of democracy are fair—everywhere—because the next decade of our nation's progress is on the line. join me and @allontheline in the fight against gerrymandering: https://t.co/d7tye8u0cd. https://t.co/rkchs3ltli
zion williamson seems like an outstanding young man as well as an outstanding basketball player. wishing him a speedy recovery.
i’m about to join @stephencurry30 on stage with @mbk_alliance to answer questions from boys and young men of color about the challenges that confront them and the opportunities within their grasp. tune in at https://t.co/swmrhub5y4.
i’ve always loved basketball because it’s about building a team that’s equal to more than the sum of its parts. glad to see this expansion into africa because for a rising continent, this can be about a lot more than what happens on the court. https://t.co/lghclaun9a
happy valentine’s day to the extraordinarily smart, beautiful, funny, one and only @michelleobama. it’s true; she does get down to motown. https://t.co/uypbzseiqb
in the year since their friends were killed, the students of parkland refused to settle for the way things are and marched, organized, and pushed for the way things should be - helping pass meaningful new gun violence laws in states across the country. i'm proud of all of them.
don’t be sad it’s over, be proud it taught us so much. congrats to all the men and women of @nasa on a @marsrovers mission that beat all expectations, inspired a new generation of americans, and demands we keep investing in science that pushes the boundaries of human knowledge.
happy 85th birthday to @realbillrussell - the greatest champion in american sports, and a lifelong warrior for justice.
my statement on the passing of former congressman john dingell: https://t.co/gjbyhhimzb
we lost two great americans today – frank robinson and john dingell – citizens who inspired me and so many others by leading on the civil rights issues of our time, opening doors to others, and leaving it all on the field.
as we celebrate black history month and jackie robinson’s 100th birthday, we celebrate the life of all whose courage opened the gates for everybody, and in the process, made america better. https://t.co/fl9adxqcgi
the @obamafoundation is connecting people from around the world so they can form partnerships just like this. i am inspired by robert and vanessa and what’s possible when leaders come together to have an even greater impact on the world. https://t.co/hfamzw7tbq
i’ve always drawn inspiration from what dr. king called life’s most persistent and urgent question: "what are you doing for others?" let’s honor his legacy by standing up for what is right in our communities and taking steps to make a positive impact on the world.
i knew it way back then and i’m absolutely convinced of it today — you’re one of a kind, @michelleobama. happy birthday! https://t.co/ejqm0uc9j4
in 2018 people stepped up and showed up like never before. keep it up in 2019. we’ve got a lot of work to do, and i’ll be right there with you. happy new year, everybody!
i hope you find inspiration in the stories of dejah, moussa, sandor, hong and jonny. their journeys began with a decision to build the better future they wanted to see. the same is true for you. what matters isn’t the size of the step you take; what matters is that you take it.
leaders like jonny boucher, a chicago native who, after losing too many friends and family to suicide, started a coffee shop to offer emotional support and guidance to those who might be in need of a little more than a strong cup of coffee to get through their day. https://t.co/h6xpcer6d9
leaders like hong hoang, who mobilized a youth-led movement to create a greener world after becoming the first vietnamese person to visit antarctica. https://t.co/k8xpnc1ocq
leaders like moussa kondo and sandor lederer, who are each doing their part to fight corruption in their native countries of mali and hungary. two people separated by continents but united in their pursuit of a more just, transparent society. https://t.co/yboxseyycd
leaders like dejah powell, who started an organization to bring health and wellness resources to communities on the south side of chicago, expanding food access and providing people the space and time to take care of themselves. https://t.co/tpw7nxtglo
as the year winds down and we look toward 2019, i’m asking you to make a commitment: find something you want to change in your community and take the first step toward changing it. if you need some inspiration, take a look at some of the young leaders who inspired me this year.
as 2018 draws to a close, i’m continuing the tradition of sharing my year-end lists. it gives me a moment to reflect on the year through the books, movies, and music that i found most thought-provoking, inspiring, or just plain loved. i hope you enjoy it: https://t.co/qz6tcmknkl
enjoy the holiday season with the ones you love. michelle and i wish you a very merry christmas! https://t.co/lklqlyffuw
there’s no better time than the holidays to give back to your community. yesterday i got to do just that at @childrenshealth. as we celebrate the season and look forward to 2019, let’s recommit to doing our part to build a world that is a little more generous, tolerant, and kind. https://t.co/77rcnoy8jn
merry christmas and happy holidays to the extraordinary kids, families, and staff at children’s national. and thanks for humoring me as your stand-in santa. https://t.co/mfmycvk7cr
today is the last day of open enrollment. that means it’s the deadline to make sure you and the people you love have health insurance in 2019. so head over to https://t.co/ob1ynoesod to get covered! here’s what else you need to know today about health care: https://t.co/gosn6c6uca
joe is right. head to https://t.co/ss87ntsgjt before tomorrow’s deadline. and nice bracelet, by the way. https://t.co/nfy3lxze3f
as bobby kennedy taught us, the thing about hope is that it travels through space *and* time, first splashing against the rocks, but eventually breaking down the walls of cruelty and injustice. and if we do our best with the time we’re given, others will take hope in our example. https://t.co/rmjgrwqhp2
no jump shots. no ferns. no memes. not this time. i’m going to give it to you straight: if you need health insurance for 2019, the deadline to get covered is december 15. go to https://t.co/ob1ynoesod today and pass this on — you just might save a life. https://t.co/8mhmsxgy0g
happy hanukkah! over these eight nights, we draw inspiration from light that can overpower any darkness, and recommit ourselves to building a brighter future for our families, our communities, and our world. chag sameach from the obama family to yours.
america has lost a patriot and humble servant in george herbert walker bush. while our hearts are heavy today, they are also filled with gratitude. our thoughts are with the entire bush family tonight – and all who were inspired by george and barbara’s example. https://t.co/g9oupu2pjy
i am grateful for the next generation of leaders -- the young people who are tolerant, creative, idealistic and doing the work to create the world as it should be. who understand that hope requires action. from the obama family to yours, happy thanksgiving. https://t.co/abjxuwch6z
